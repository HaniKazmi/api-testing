The Internet, and more specifically the World Wide Web, is a rAPIdly evolving platform. With the advent of HTML5 and the current abundance of processing resources, websites have been evolving into 'web apps', which require extensive testing to ensure it is error free. These tests currently consist of manually written 'unit tests', which target individually modules and raise an error if future work breaks the module. Of particular note are 'web APIs', sets of endpoints used to communicate between components of web apps. They are generally strictly defined, and therefore there is scope for automatic testing to ensure compliance with their specification.

This thesis focuses on a subset of these APIs: those classified as 'restful', and creates a framework consisting of three components - a language to formally define the API, automatic tests to reaffirm that the specification matches a given implementation, and unit test generation from the aforementioned specification. The thesis will use the API provided by the company 'Livedrive' as a case study.
